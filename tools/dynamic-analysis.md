# Dynamic Analysis

## About

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is another testing method that uses a black-box approach, assuming the testers don’t have access or knowledge of the application’s source code or its inner functionality. They test the application from outside using the available outputs and inputs \[1].
