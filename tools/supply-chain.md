# Supply Chain

## About

Software supply chain security involves securing all aspects of the process of developing and delivering software, from the initial design and coding phases, through third-party components, to the end-user's system. It's about ensuring that every link in the chain is as secure as possible to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, or other malicious activities.
