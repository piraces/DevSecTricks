# Vulnerabilities Analysis

## About

Software vulnerability analysis is a process that identifies, classifies, and helps to mitigate weaknesses in software systems. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious users or software, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, system disruption, and more. The goal of vulnerability analysis is to secure the software system by managing these risks.
