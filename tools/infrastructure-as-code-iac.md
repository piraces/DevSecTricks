# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Tools

* Aqua [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) ([web](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/)): a static analysis security scanner for your Terraform code.
* Tenable [terrascan](https://github.com/tenable/terrascan) ([web](https://runterrascan.io/)): Detect compliance and security violations across Infrastructure as Code to mitigate risk before provisioning cloud native infrastructure.
* Bridgecrew [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) ([web](https://www.checkov.io/)): prevent cloud misconfigurations and find vulnerabilities during build-time in infrastructure as code, container images and open source packages.
* [Regula](https://github.com/fugue/regula) ([web](https://regula.dev/)): checks infrastructure as code templates (Terraform, CloudFormation, k8s manifests) for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes security and compliance using Open Policy Agent/Rego.
* [Terraform Compliance](https://github.com/terraform-compliance/cli) ([web](https://terraform-compliance.com/)): is a lightweight, security and compliance focused test framework against terraform to enable negative testing capability for your infrastructure-as-code.
* Checkmarx [kics](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics) ([web](https://kics.io/)): keeping infrastructure as code secure is an open source solution for static code analysis of Infrastructure as Code.
* Stelligent [Cfn Nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn\_nag): looks for patterns in CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure.
* [ggshield ](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield)([GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/)): find and fix hardcoded secrets and infrastructure-as-code misconfigurations.
* [Ansible lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) ([web](https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/)): ansible-lint checks playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved.
