# Discussions

GitHub offers great functionality for open-source collaboration and one of them is ["GitHub Discussions"](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions), which is a collaborative communication forum for the community around the project.

You can participate in this by opening an issue, editing or adding pages... but you can also discuss about some topics documented in here!

Go to the ["Discussions" tab in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/piraces/DevSecTricks/discussions) for this page to get started.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please take into account the different sections in the "Discussions" section and try to use them appropriately and always following the [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).
{% endhint %}
