  aggregate all things related to a secure development & operations (always from
  the DEV perspective).

# DevSec

**Welcome to the page where you will find all security related topics/tools/techniques made by developers for developers concerned about security.**

This page is intended as an always updated source for devs, inspired in the work of ["HackTricks"](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/), to serve as a reference for a secure development and related operations.

### Introduction

You may heard about **DevSecOps**, the **shifting left** concept and **GitOps**...\[1] They all share a lot of principles, **reduce the time devs spend on security while achieving their objectives.**

With **DevOps**, we shifted to make developers more accountable for operational topics and issues (joining the responsability of development and operations). Here the same mindset is meant to be done with Security in DevSecOps.

In lots of products or projects we are already shifting left a lot of controls earlier in the development lifecycle, where the development teams are (such as testing)... So why not including security testing to an earlier step? We could make fewer mistakes, and we can move more quickly (quickly addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities and fixing them).

**This is a process change, it's not about a single/specific tool or controls. It's about making all of security more developer-centric.**

### **State of security**
